DAY-1:

relu - The rectified linear activation function overcomes the vanishing gradient problem, allowing models to learn
faster and perform better.
Loss function â€”This measures how accurate the model is during training. You want to minimize this function to "steer"
the model in the right direction.
EPOCH=number of epochs is a hyperparameter that defines the number times that the learning algorithm will work through
the entire training dataset
The expand_dims() function is used to expand the shape of an array. Insert a new axis that will appear at the axis
position in the expanded array shape.

  -use the Large Movie Review Dataset that contains the text of 50,000 movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database. 
  -.cache() keeps data in memory after it's loaded off disk.
